I'm going to try something silly and ridiculous and probably won't work. But here it goes. I've come up with an idea for a universal editor. I'm going to teach myself Tkinter in python and create this program in 5 hours. it isn't a complex program so it has potential. but Really thinking I could teach myself Tkinter and make a program in the next 5 hours is foolishness. but here we go! Fugere coming down the pike.
