I recently had a little explosion on stack overflow. While I'm not afraid to admit I was probably in the wrong and the one being un-reasonable, I think my point still stands. I wanted a simple introduction geometry shaders that would help me wrap my mind around how they work. Most of what I ran aacross was either very poor in quality (poor explainations, poor examples, specific to systems or enviorments) or far to technical (lots of words or phrases that aren't familiar to un-skilled users, a feeling that you already understand how the rest of the system works and this is just adding ona new feature to what you already know, etc). So I wanted to see if anyone out there new of a good tutorial. My question was closed as not actually a question.

I'm taking a potentially perminant hiatus from any interactions with SO till I calm down. But also, it made me think. Of what quality is my OpenCL tutorial? I think Winkle was trying to get me to understand this too. It wasn't helpful for some one who doesn't already know how the system works. So. I'm taking a step back with my openCL intro. I'm going to see if I might be able to incorporate pictures and explain better how serialization works.
