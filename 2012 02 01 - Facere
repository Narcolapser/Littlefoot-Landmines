I made a suprise amount of progress truth be told. I've got nodes, arcs, and connecting dots. I don't hav the ability to connect things yet, nor is there any functionality in the back end. But when I actually get around to making the functional backend, that will go rather quickly I feel. I know exactly how I want to do that.

This was an experiement of will. Can I just sit down and decide "I'm going to make this" and try to just simply make it? I certainly can. It is kind of nice to finally get a little bit of a handle on creating GUIs with python. I've learned quite a bit this evening and I've got a lot to ponder as I push forward with Facere. But I'm pleased with what I've got thus far.
