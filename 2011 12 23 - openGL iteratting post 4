4th and final day, here's what I've got for you:

Iteration 14: View ports - http://ubuntuone.com/3rW6dLZtd2cmq4gE6pXyau
	Shader - http://ubuntuone.com/3vgpAHIzy3E3X8MPZ6HCmk
Iteration 15: Adding animation and resizing - http://ubuntuone.com/2Xs7zT8Zp5vOi4dOONUBAZ

only 2 more iterations today. But That wraps up my series of comentaries I think. There is more, it goes on to texturing and loading an obj. but as of iteration 15 you have all of the most basic systems in place for a video game. Particularly you should feel well equiped to be able to continue on to other tutorials. i might describe a little more how graphics systems work later. but for now I'm happy with what I've accomplished in this series. enjoy.
