I've started to write up my itterations through to make an openGL program. I'm really just following through with this tutorial: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming/Modern_OpenGL_Introduction but I hope my comments will help newbies ease into openGL a little better. here they are, enjoy:

itteration 1: Making a bloody window: http://ubuntuone.com/5B7HTDmUDCQdjmXuj0fPIR
itteration 2: Making a basic render pipeline: (coming as soon as I get the link form Ubuntu one)
